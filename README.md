# LlamaIndex-Projects

LlamaIndex  serves as an interface that manages interactions with LLMs by creating an index from input data, enabling responses to questions related to the data. This framework offers a variety of connectors for data ingestion from diverse sources like PDFs, PowerPoints, Notion, Slack, and databases such as Postgres and MongoDB. LlamaIndex is highly versatile, capable of crafting different index types like vector, tree, list, or keyword indexes based on specific needs.

In this repository, I have utilized open-source models using this framework to make agents capable of function calling i.e Agentic RAG.
